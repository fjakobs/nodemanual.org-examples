I was living next door to the high school. 
In the evenings the lights would go on and 
I would  see men and women in the 
rooms. I would see them moving around 
but I wouldn't be able to hear them. I 
could see that they were saying something 
among themselves and I thought I would 
like to go among them and listen. It was a 
place to go. I didn't want to improve my 
mind. I was through with all that. 
I was getting a  letter from the Pelman 
Institute of America every two weeks. I 
wasn't taking their course. I wasn't even 
opening the envelopes. I knew exactly 
what they were saying. They were saying 
Chesterton and Ben Lindsay had taken 
their course and now had fine big brains, 
especially Chesterton. I knew they were 
telling me I too could have a fine big 
brain, but I wasn't opening the envelopes. 
I was turning the matter over to my niece
who was four years old. I was thinking 
maybe she would like to take the course 
and have a brain like the wise men of the 
world. I was giving the letters to my niece, 
and she was taking them and sitting on 
the floor and cutting them with a pair of 
scissors. The Institute is a great American 
idea. My niece is cutting the letters with a 
small pair of scissors. 
It was a place to go at night. I was tired of 
the radio. I had heard NRA speeches, 
excerpts from Carmen, Tosti's "Good-bye" 
and "Trees" every night for over a year. 
Sometimes twice a night. I knew what 
would happen every night. It was the 
same downtown. I knew all the movies, 
what to expect. The  pattern never 
changed. It was the same with 
symphonies even. Once a lady conducted, 
but it was the same,  Beethoven's Fifth, 
The Sorcerer's Apprentice, and  The Blue 
Danube Walt
