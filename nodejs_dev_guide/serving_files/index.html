<h1>Let me read you a poem!</h1>

<p>when serpents bargain for the right to squirm<br/>
and the sun strikes to gain a living wage -<br/>
when thorns regard their roses with alarm<br/>
and rainbows are insured against old age</p>

<p>when every thrush may sing no new moon in<br/>
if all screech-owls have not okayed his voice<br/>
- and any wave signs on the dotted line<br/>
or else an ocean is compelled to close</p>

<p>when the oak begs permission of the birch<br/>
to make an acorn - valleys accuse their<br/>
mountains of having altitude - and march<br/>
denounces april as a saboteur</p>

<p>then we'll believe in that incredible<br/>
unanimal mankind (and not until)</p>
