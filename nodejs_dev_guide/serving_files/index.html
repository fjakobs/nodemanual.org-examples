<h1>Let me read you a poem!</h1>

<p>when serpents bargain for the right to squirm
and the sun strikes to gain a living wage -
when thorns regard their roses with alarm
and rainbows are insured against old age</p>

<p>when every thrush may sing no new moon in
if all screech-owls have not okayed his voice
- and any wave signs on the dotted line
or else an ocean is compelled to close</p>

<p>when the oak begs permission of the birch
to make an acorn - valleys accuse their
mountains of having altitude - and march
denounces april as a saboteur</p>

<p>then we'll believe in that incredible
unanimal mankind (and not until)</p>
